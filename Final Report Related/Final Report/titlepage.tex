    \begin{abstract}
        This study deduces that reionization began at a redshift of $z=17.82(+3.06, -2.4)$ and ended at a redshift of $z=7\pm 1.8$. This is calculated by directly applying the dynamics of star formation and the ionization rate of neutral hydrogen in the Inter-galactic Medium. A photometry strategy consisting of 3 multi-band surveys is proposed in order to observe Lyman Break Galaxies across redshifts 6--17. The surveys will locate $100.5\pm37.0$, $138.7\pm 100.6$, $358.1\pm 158.6$ galaxies in redshift ranges 6--8.5, 8.5--10 and 10--17 respectively. These surveys will be completed by the James Webb Space Telescope and Euclid which are planned for launch in the coming decade. A follow up spectroscopy survey will be used to confirm the redshift and properties of 24, 4 and 48 galaxies in these 3 surveys respectively. The spectroscopy will be carried out using James Webb Space Telescope and a combination of single and multi-slit spectroscopy. It is shown that the use of known gravitational lenses, located between redshift 0.5--0.7, is very beneficial for discovering high redshift candidates as it can increase the depth of surveys by up to 3 magnitudes.
