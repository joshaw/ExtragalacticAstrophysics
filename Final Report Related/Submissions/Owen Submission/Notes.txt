both graphs have axis of star formation rate density (y axis)
(solar masses per year per megaparsec cubed)

and redshift (x axis)

in graph2 the middle column is critical SFR density and the right most 
column is simply SFR density.

TITLES:
GRAPH 1 - Critical Star Formation Rate Density Against Redshift
GRAPH 2 - Critical Star Formation Rate Density and Star Formation Rate Density against Redshift


Thanks!
